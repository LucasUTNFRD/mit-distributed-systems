a **lease** is a mechanism used to maintain **consistent ordering of write operations** across replicas of a chunk. The lease is granted by the **master server** to one of the **chunkservers** that hold replicas of a chunk, designating it as the **primary chunkserver** for that chunk. The primary chunkserver is responsible for coordinating all **mutations** (writes or record appends) to the chunk, ensuring that all replicas apply the writes in the same order.

### Key Characteristics of a Lease:

1. **Lease Holder**: The chunkserver that receives the lease is called the **primary chunkserver**. Other chunkservers with replicas of the chunk are known as **secondary chunkservers**.
    
2. **Lease Duration**: The lease typically has a **timeout period** (e.g., 60 seconds), during which the primary chunkserver controls the order of writes. The primary can request lease extensions as long as there are active writes.
    
3. **Write Coordination**: The **primary chunkserver** decides the **serial order** of write requests from clients. It assigns a serial number to each write and ensures that the secondary chunkservers apply the writes in the same order, preserving consistency.
    
4. **Lease Extension**: If the chunk is actively being written to, the primary chunkserver can request and receive lease extensions from the master to continue managing the chunk's mutations.
    
5. **Master Involvement**: The master grants the lease and can revoke it or reassign it if needed, such as in cases of failure or when renaming files that involve the chunk.

The lease mechanism ensures:
- **Consistency**: All chunk replicas apply writes in the same order.
- **Reduced Master Load**: The master server is not involved in every write operation, as the primary chunkserver manages write ordering.
- **Fault Tolerance**: If the lease holder fails, the master can reassign the lease to another chunkserver.
